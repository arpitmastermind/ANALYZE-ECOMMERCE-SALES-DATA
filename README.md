## Problem Statement

This e-commerce business dashboard lacks sufficient insights to make informed decisions about sales strategies and customer targeting.

While the dashboard provides a basic overview of sales performance, it doesn't delve into crucial metrics like:

Customer Acquisition Cost (CAC): Understanding how much it costs to acquire a new customer is essential for optimizing marketing campaigns and maximizing return on investment (ROI).

Customer Lifetime Value (CLV): Knowing the total revenue a customer generates over their relationship with the business is vital for prioritizing customer retention efforts.

Product profitability: Identifying high and low-margin products allows for informed decisions about product pricing, marketing, and inventory management.

The dashboard primarily focuses on sales by state and quantity by category, but it doesn't explore:

Customer demographics: Understanding the age, gender, location, and other relevant characteristics of the customer base can help tailor marketing campaigns and product offerings to specific segments.

Product performance by category and subcategory: Analyzing sales data by subcategory can reveal granular insights into which specific products within a category are driving sales and which ones might require adjustments.

By incorporating these additional metrics and insights, the dashboard could provide a more comprehensive picture of the e-commerce business's sales performance and customer behavior, enabling data-driven decision making for improved marketing strategies, product development, and customer targeting.

Here are some additional observations about the dashboard in the image:

The dashboard shows sales performance over four quarters.
It displays total sales amount, profit, quantity (presumably number of units sold), and average order value (AOV).
Sales data is also presented by state and by customer name.
There is a breakdown of quantity by category (e.g., furniture, electronics, clothing) and profit by subcategory.
Payment methods used by customers are also displayed.
Overall, while the dashboard provides a starting point for sales analysis, it could be enhanced to provide more actionable insights for the business.
